    <h1>Capsule Crew Dragon</h1>

    <div class="text-box">
        <p>Crew Dragon is equipped with an integrated launch escape system 
            (LES) consisting of eight SuperDraco engines, capable of accelerating 
            the vehicle away from the rocket in an emergency. 
            The spacecraft features redesigned solar arrays and a modified 
            outer mold line compared to the original Dragon, and possesses 
            new flight computers and avionics. As of March 2020, 
            four operational Dragon 2 spacecraft have been manufactured, 
            as well as several unflown test articles.
            Crew Dragon serves as one of two spacecraft that are expected to 
            transport crews to and from the ISS under NASA's Commercial 
            Crew Program, the other being the Boeing CST-100 Starliner;
